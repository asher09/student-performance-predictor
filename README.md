Student Performance Predictor ðŸŽ“
Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end machine learning solution designed to predict student performance based on a variety of academic and socio-demographic factors. It is built with a modular and pipeline-driven architecture to provide a robust framework for data processing, model training, and performance prediction. The primary goal is to help educators and parents identify at-risk students early and implement timely interventions.

Key Features
Modular Code Structure: The project is organized into distinct modules for better maintainability and reusability.

End-to-End ML Pipeline: Includes pipelines for data ingestion, data transformation, and model training.

Predictive Modeling: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to accurately predict student scores or grades.

Data Analysis: Provides insights into the most influential factors affecting student performance.

Automated Workflow: The pipeline can be triggered to retrain the model with new data automatically.

Project Structure
The project follows a standard machine learning module structure to ensure a clear and scalable workflow.

data/: Contains the raw dataset used for training the model.
src/: The core source code directory.
components/: Houses the individual components of the ML pipeline.
pipeline/: Integrates the components into a cohesive workflow.
exception.py, logger.py: Custom modules for error handling and logging.
requirements.txt: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies.

Installation
To set up the project on your local machine, follow these steps:
```
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/asher09/student-performance-predictor.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd student-performance-predictor

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Usage
Training the Model
```
To train the model from scratch, run the training pipeline:

python src/pipeline/training_pipeline.py
This will execute the data ingestion, transformation, and model training steps, saving the best-performing model to a file (e.g., model.pkl).
```

Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language.

Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy.

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn for modeling and pipelines.
